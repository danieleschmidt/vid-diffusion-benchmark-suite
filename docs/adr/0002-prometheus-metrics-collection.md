# ADR-0002: Prometheus Metrics Collection

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The benchmark suite needs comprehensive metrics collection for:
- Model performance monitoring (latency, throughput, resource usage)
- System health monitoring (GPU utilization, memory, power consumption)
- Quality metrics tracking (FVD scores, temporal consistency, etc.)
- Operational metrics (API response times, error rates, queue depths)

Requirements for metrics system:
- Real-time collection and alerting
- Historical data retention for trend analysis
- Integration with visualization tools (Grafana)
- Low overhead collection to avoid affecting benchmark results
- Standardized metric naming and labeling

## Decision

We will use Prometheus as our primary metrics collection and storage system:

1. **Prometheus Server** for metrics collection and storage
2. **Custom exporters** for model-specific metrics
3. **Node Exporter** for system-level metrics
4. **cAdvisor** for container metrics
5. **Grafana** for visualization and dashboards
6. **AlertManager** for alerting and notifications

Metric categories:
- `benchmark_*`: Model evaluation metrics (FVD, IS, latency)
- `system_*`: Hardware utilization (GPU, CPU, memory, power)
- `container_*`: Container resource usage
- `api_*`: REST API performance metrics
- `queue_*`: Processing queue metrics

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Standardized metrics**: Consistent naming and labeling across all components
- **Real-time monitoring**: Immediate visibility into system performance
- **Historical analysis**: Trend analysis and performance regression detection
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of issues or anomalies
- **Scalability**: Prometheus designed for high-cardinality metrics
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of exporters and integrations

### Negative
- **Storage overhead**: Prometheus requires significant disk space for retention
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn PromQL for queries and alerts
- **Network overhead**: Metrics collection adds network traffic
- **Configuration complexity**: Requires careful configuration for optimal performance

### Implementation Details
- Metrics retention: 30 days for high-resolution, 1 year for downsampled
- Collection interval: 15 seconds for critical metrics, 60 seconds for others
- Label strategy: model_name, container_id, gpu_id, prompt_category
- Alert thresholds: GPU utilization >95%, memory usage >90%, error rate >5%
