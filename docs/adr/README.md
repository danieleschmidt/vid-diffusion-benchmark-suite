# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Video Diffusion Benchmark Suite project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project's development. They provide context for future developers and help explain why certain design choices were made.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```

## Index

| Number | Title | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| [0001](0001-containerized-model-isolation.md) | Containerized Model Isolation | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-prometheus-metrics-collection.md) | Prometheus Metrics Collection | Accepted |
| [0003](0003-standardized-evaluation-protocol.md) | Standardized Evaluation Protocol | Accepted |

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR file: `XXXX-short-title.md`
2. Follow the template structure
3. Discuss with the team
4. Update the index above
5. Commit the ADR with your implementation
