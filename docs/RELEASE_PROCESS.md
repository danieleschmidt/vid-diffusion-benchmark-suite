## Release Branch Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main
├── release/v0.2.x (minor release branch)
├── release/v0.1.x (previous minor, maintenance only)
└── hotfix/v0.1.5  (emergency patches)
```

### Branch Lifecycle
1. **Feature Development**: Feature branches merged to `main`
2. **Release Preparation**: Create `release/vX.Y.x` branch from `main`
3. **Release Candidate**: Tag and test release candidates
4. **Final Release**: Tag final release and merge back to `main`
5. **Hotfixes**: Create `hotfix/vX.Y.Z` branches as needed

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning Rules
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes, removed functionality
- **MINOR**: New features, new model support, backward-compatible changes
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security patches, documentation updates

### Version Bumping Process
```bash
# Update version in pyproject.toml
sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "X.Y.Z"/' pyproject.toml

# Update version references in documentation
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+/vX.Y.Z/g' {} \;

# Commit version changes
git add pyproject.toml docs/
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
```

## Release Candidate Process

### RC Creation
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v0.2.x main

# Create RC tag
git tag -a v0.2.0-rc.1 -m "Release candidate v0.2.0-rc.1"
git push origin v0.2.0-rc.1
```

### RC Testing
- **Automated Testing**: Full test suite execution across supported platforms
- **Manual Testing**: Core functionality verification by maintainers
- **Community Testing**: Beta testing with select community members
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark comparison with previous version

### RC Approval Criteria
- All automated tests pass
- Manual testing confirms core functionality
- Performance within 5% of previous version
- Security scan results acceptable
- Community feedback addressed

## Release Execution

### Automated Release Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml (when GitHub Actions available)
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build and Test
      - name: Security Scan
      - name: Package Creation
      - name: Artifact Signing
      - name: PyPI Upload
      - name: Docker Image Build
      - name: GitHub Release Creation
      - name: Documentation Deployment
```

### Manual Release Steps
```bash
# 1. Final version tagging
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"

# 2. Build packages
python -m build
twine check dist/*

# 3. Sign artifacts
gpg --detach-sign --armor dist/*.tar.gz
gpg --detach-sign --armor dist/*.whl

# 4. Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*

# 5. Create GitHub release
gh release create v0.2.0 dist/* \
  --title "Release v0.2.0" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md

# 6. Build and push Docker images
docker build -t vid-diffusion-bench:v0.2.0 .
docker push vid-diffusion-bench:v0.2.0
```
