# Terragon Autonomous SDLC System

This directory contains the Terragon Autonomous Software Development Lifecycle enhancement system - a continuous value discovery and execution framework.

## 🎯 Overview

The Terragon system automatically:

1. **Discovers** value opportunities from multiple sources (git history, static analysis, security scans, etc.)
2. **Scores** each opportunity using WSJF, ICE, and Technical Debt models
3. **Prioritizes** based on composite value scores and risk assessment  
4. **Executes** the highest-value tasks autonomously
5. **Learns** from outcomes to improve future scoring and execution

## 📁 System Components

### Core Engine Files

- `value-config.yaml` - Configuration for scoring models, thresholds, and execution parameters
- `value-discovery-engine.py` - Main discovery engine that finds and scores opportunities
- `autonomous-executor.py` - Executes prioritized tasks automatically
- `scheduler.py` - Manages continuous execution cycles
- `value-metrics.json` - Tracks execution history and learning data

### Generated Files

- `../BACKLOG.md` - Live autonomous backlog with prioritized tasks
- Execution logs and metrics in JSON format

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Single Discovery Cycle
```bash
cd /root/repo
python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py
```

### Execute Next Highest-Value Task
```bash
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

### Run Continuous Autonomous Cycles
```bash
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py 5  # Run 5 cycles
```

## 📊 Value Scoring Model

The system uses a hybrid scoring approach:

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
- **User Business Value**: Impact on users and business outcomes
- **Time Criticality**: Urgency and deadline pressure
- **Risk Reduction**: Risk mitigation and stability improvement
- **Opportunity Enablement**: Future value unlocking

### ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- **Impact**: Expected business and technical impact (1-10)
- **Confidence**: Certainty in estimation and execution (1-10)
- **Ease**: Implementation difficulty and resource requirements (1-10)

### Technical Debt Scoring
- **Debt Impact**: Maintenance hours saved by addressing debt
- **Debt Interest**: Future cost if debt remains unaddressed
- **Hotspot Multiplier**: Code churn and complexity factors

### Composite Score Calculation
```
CompositeScore = (
    0.6 × WSJF_Score +
    0.1 × ICE_Score +
    0.2 × TechnicalDebt_Score +
    0.1 × Security_Boost
) × Hotspot_Multiplier
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Key Configuration Areas

**Scoring Weights** (`.terragon/value-config.yaml`)
```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    maturing:  # Weights for MATURING maturity repositories
      wsjf: 0.6
      ice: 0.1
      technicalDebt: 0.2
      security: 0.1
```

**Execution Thresholds**
```yaml
thresholds:
  minScore: 15              # Minimum score to execute
  maxRisk: 0.7              # Maximum acceptable risk
  securityBoost: 2.0        # Security priority multiplier
```

**Discovery Sources**
```yaml
discovery:
  sources:
    - gitHistory
    - staticAnalysis
    - vulnerabilityDatabases
    - performanceMonitoring
    - documentationGaps
```

## 📈 Metrics and Learning

### Execution History
The system tracks all executions with:
- Estimated vs actual effort
- Value delivered vs predicted
- Success/failure rates
- Execution duration and efficiency

### Continuous Learning
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Tracks estimation accuracy over time
- **Model Recalibration**: Automatically adjusts scoring when accuracy drops
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from similar task outcomes

### Value Metrics
- Total value delivered (scored)
- Technical debt reduction
- Security improvements
- Performance gains
- SDLC maturity advancement

## 🎛️ Operational Modes

### Development Mode
```bash
python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py --dry-run
```
Discovers and scores opportunities without execution.

### Autonomous Mode
```bash
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py
```
Fully autonomous continuous execution (production mode).

### Single Task Mode
```bash
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```
Executes only the next highest-priority task.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

The system integrates with your existing CI/CD:

### GitHub Actions Integration
Automatic execution triggers:
- After PR merges (discovery cycle)
- Nightly (comprehensive analysis)
- Weekly (deep SDLC review)

### Local Development
```bash
# Add to git hooks
echo "python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py --dry-run" >> .git/hooks/post-commit
```

## 📋 Current Repository Status

**Maturity Level**: MATURING (50-75% SDLC maturity)

**Latest Improvements**:

## 🛡️ Security and Safety

### Execution Safety
- Execution windows (2 AM - 6 AM UTC by default)
- Risk threshold enforcement (max 0.7 risk score)
- Automatic rollback on test failures
- Human override capabilities

### Data Security
- No sensitive data in learning models
- Encrypted metrics storage (configurable)
- Audit logging for all actions
- Compliance framework integration

## 🔗 Integration Points

### External Systems
- **GitHub**: Issues, PRs, Actions integration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana dashboards
- **Security**: Vulnerability database APIs

- **IDE extensions**: Value highlighting
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated from execution

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Custom Task Types
Extend the executor for new task categories:

```python
# In autonomous-executor.py
def _execute_custom_task(self, task):
    # Your custom task implementation
    pass
```

### Custom Scoring Models
Add domain-specific scoring in `value-config.yaml`:

```yaml
valueModel:
  custom_category:
    weight: 0.3
    factors: ["domain_specific_metric"]
```

### Custom Discovery Sources
Extend discovery engine for new signal sources:

```python
# In value-discovery-engine.py
def _analyze_custom_source(self):
    # Your custom discovery logic
    pass
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Discovery Engine Not Finding Issues**
- Check if analysis tools are installed (ruff, mypy, etc.)
- Verify repository permissions
- Check `.terragon/value-config.yaml` discovery sources

**Executor Not Running Tasks**
- Verify execution window settings
- Check minimum score thresholds
- Review risk assessment criteria

**Metrics Not Updating**
- Check file permissions on `.terragon/` directory
- Verify JSON format in metrics files
- Review error logs in execution output

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py --debug
```
