## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Technical Complexity**: Diverse model architectures may be difficult to standardize
   - *Mitigation*: Start with most popular models, build extensible adapter framework
2. **Resource Constraints**: GPU compute costs may exceed budget
   - *Mitigation*: Seek infrastructure partnerships, optimize evaluation efficiency
3. **Community Adoption**: Researchers may resist standardized evaluation
   - *Mitigation*: Engage early adopters, demonstrate clear value proposition

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Competition**: Existing platforms may expand into video evaluation
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on video-specific features, build strong community
2. **Model Licensing**: Some models may have restrictive licensing
   - *Mitigation*: Clearly document licensing requirements, respect restrictions
3. **Evaluation Bias**: Metrics may favor certain model architectures
   - *Mitigation*: Community-driven metric validation, multiple evaluation approaches
