# Project Charter: Video Diffusion Benchmark Suite

## Executive Summary

The Video Diffusion Benchmark Suite is a comprehensive, standardized framework for evaluating video generation models. As the field of video diffusion models has exploded from dozens to 300+ models, the need for fair, reproducible, and standardized evaluation has become critical for both research advancement and practical deployment decisions.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Fragmented Evaluation**: Each research group uses different metrics, datasets, and evaluation protocols
2. **Reproducibility Crisis**: Results cannot be reproduced due to varying environments and parameters
3. **Unfair Comparisons**: Models evaluated under different conditions cannot be fairly compared
4. **Deployment Uncertainty**: No reliable data for making production deployment decisions
5. **Resource Waste**: Redundant evaluation efforts across the research community

### Market Impact
- Research teams spend 40-60% of their time on evaluation infrastructure instead of model development
- Production teams struggle to select appropriate models for their use cases
- Academic progress is hindered by lack of standardized comparison metrics
- Commercial adoption is slowed by uncertainty about model performance

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Standardized Evaluation Protocol**: Fixed prompts, parameters, metrics, and environments
- **Model Registry**: Support for 300+ video diffusion models with containerized isolation
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Quality, efficiency, and temporal consistency measurements
- **Live Leaderboard**: Real-time rankings and performance tracking
- **Hardware Profiling**: Resource usage analysis for deployment planning
- **Reproducible Infrastructure**: Docker containers, fixed seeds, version control

### Out of Scope
- **Model Development**: We evaluate existing models, not develop new ones
- **Commercial Licensing**: Focus on open-source models and research use cases
- **Real-time Generation**: Evaluation only, not production inference serving
- **Data Generation**: Use existing datasets, not create new training data

- **Phase 3 (Months 7-12)**: Production features, enterprise adoption
- **Phase 4 (Year 2)**: Advanced research tools, AI-powered features

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Model Compatibility**: Rapid changes in model architectures may break evaluation
  - *Mitigation*: Containerized isolation, versioned model adapters
- **Resource Costs**: GPU compute costs may exceed budget projections
  - *Mitigation*: Efficient batching, cloud cost monitoring, sponsorship

### Medium Risk
- **Community Adoption**: Research community may not adopt new standard
  - *Mitigation*: Early engagement with key researchers, conference presentations
- **Technical Debt**: Rapid development may compromise code quality
  - *Mitigation*: Automated testing, code reviews, refactoring cycles

### Low Risk
- **Competition**: Other evaluation frameworks may emerge
  - *Mitigation*: Open source approach, community collaboration
- **Regulatory Changes**: AI regulations may affect evaluation requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Flexible architecture, compliance documentation

## Governance Structure

### Decision Making
- **Technical Decisions**: Technical lead with team consensus
- **Strategic Decisions**: Stakeholder advisory board
- **Community Issues**: Community manager with escalation path
- **Emergency Issues**: On-call rotation with clear escalation procedures

### Quality Assurance
